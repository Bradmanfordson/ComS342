## Description
COMS/SE 342: Principles of Programming Languages. Prereq: Minimum of C- in COM
S 228 and MATH 165; COM S 230 or CPR E 310 
Study of concepts in programming languages,especially functional programming concepts. 
Overview of major programming paradigms, their re-lationship, and tradeoffs among paradigms 
enabling sound choices of programming language for application-specific development. 
Programming projects.

## Student Academic Accommodation Request
Iowa State University is committed to assuring that all educational activities are free from dis-
crimination and harassment based on disability status. All students requesting accommodations
are required to meet with staff in Student Disability Resources (SDR) to establish eligibility. A
Student Academic Accommodation Request (SAAR) form will be provided to eligible students.
The provision of reasonable accommodations in this course will be arranged after timely delivery
of the SAAR form to the instructor. Students are encouraged to deliver completed SAAR forms as
early in the semester as possible. SDR, a unit in the Dean of Students Office, is located in room
1076, Student Services Building or online at www.dso.iastate.edu/dr/. Contact SDR by e-mail at
disabilityresources@iastate.edu or by phone at 515-294-7220 for additional information.
Policy for Academic Dishonesty
You are encouraged to discuss course materials with classmates and organize group study ses-
sions. Studying together and explaining each other concepts and materials discussed in class and
recitations often help in improving the understanding of the topics and enhance the learning expe-
rience. However, each of you must work separately on your assignments (homework assignments
and exams). For instance, the following (non-exhaustive) activities are strictly prohibited:
1. Writing solutions together
2. Copying from another student
3. Sharing part of or whole solutions (e.g., posting, emailing, printing and handing over)
4. Posting course assignments on the Web and asking for solutions
2
In short, apply common sense and when in doubt, ask the instructor and TAs to ascertain that
your activities are not prohibited.
In an unfortunate event that we suspect academic misconduct, the case will pursued in ac-
cordance to ISU policies (http://catalog.iastate.edu/academic conduct/#academicdishonestytext).
Anyone found responsible for academic misconduct may receive a failing grade F in the course.
